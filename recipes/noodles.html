<h2>Description</h2>
    <p>
        The perfect recipe for alcoholics! According to its inventor, this noodle dish is a spicy, sweet, and savory bowl of noodles invented by and for drunk people. However, there is another theory
        floating about claiming that the noodle dish's name derives from the fact that the recipe once used wine in its sauce. Regardless of how drunken noodles came about, it is an easy recipe that yields incredibly
        delicious noodles! 
    </p>
    <p>
        The key to perfecting this dish lies in preparing the rice noodles. No matter what size or thickness you're using, you need to soak them in hot water until they are very flexible but not soft. Avoid 
        boiling the water despite the "Steps" portion of the recipe below, as you may overcook the noodles accidentally and become overly starchy; After all, rice noodles are fast to cook. While it is recommended to use rice 
        noodles, you can use any noodle or pasta with this sauce with incredible results!
